## My process

This project was not difficult, but rather fun to make. I tried to keep my code as simple and clean as possible. I used div container for the actual card, and some flex box to position the elements in a column. To attribute the design and challenge to Frontend Mentor I put this section in a html semantic footer. Once I was done, pushed the folder to online GitHub respository, see the Solution URL [GitHub] and posted a live version of the Netlify.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Figma

### What I learned

For the mobile version I saw no need to use media queries.

I did check for optimization by running Lighthouse and got 100's for the Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and I received a 91 for SEO.

This was my first time using Figma. I enjoyed using this tool very much. I loved that it gave specific details to the padding, margins, font-color and specific sizes of the card and the QR image. Very nice!

### Continued development

I look forward to future projects where I will be implementing animations as well a using CSS Grid. I had fun using Flexbox.

I look forward to implementing projects that involve using Javascript, the DOM, Figma.

### Useful resources

In the learning path there is a great resource for using git to upload to the GitHub respository. Thank you for that awesome resource, very exciting stuff!
